# Windows-GodMode-Powershell

## Archival
Now that PowerTools exists for Windows, this utility is no longer needed so this script has been retired. However, this small script can still be referenced and used. There are no code changes needed to implement GM in the future.

## About
Very simple script to auto-create the GodMode shell on Windows 10 &amp; 11 on the Desktop.

## Notes
The only parameter that may need changed is the folder location that you may want to create GodMode at. By default this auto-creates on the Desktop. It will grab your PC name on its own.
