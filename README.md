# Windows-GodMode-Powershell
Simple script to auto-create the GodMode shell on Windows 10 &amp; 11 on the Desktop.

## Notes
The only parameter that may need changed is the folder location that you may want to create GodMode at. By default this auto-creates on the Desktop. It will grab your PC name on its own.
